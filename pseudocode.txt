//Rock Paper Scissors

create three variables:
    rock with a string value of 'Rock'
    paper with a string value of 'Paper'
    scissors with a string value of 'scissors'

create an array of three elements called choices
    0, rock
    1, paper
    2, scissors

computerChoice function
    create a random number that accesses an element in the array called choices
        use a math random function and multiply by three
        surround product of math random function by math floor function
        include product as en element of the array of choices
    return value of the current position in the array

playerSelection function
    prompt user for a choice of 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'
    use the length function to determine a value called choice
    iterate through a loop of 3
        if value === 4, store convserion as 0
        if value === 5, store convserion as 1
        if value === 8, store convserion as 2
    store newValue choices array
    return value of choices

round function
    take computerPlay and playerSelection as parameters
    if computerPlay === playerSelection
        console.log("Draw!")
        return
    else
    generate losing and winning conditions

game function
    call round function 5x
    print player with most points
        if points are even, declare a draw
